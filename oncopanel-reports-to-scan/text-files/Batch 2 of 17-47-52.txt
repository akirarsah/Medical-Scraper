CHROMOSOMAL REARRANGEMENT :

Translocation review identifies a rearrangement involving intron 1 of SCL1A2 and
an intragenic region on chromosome 14 (breakpoints: 14:22975100;11:35358530).
Although the significance of this particular structural variation is unclear,
SLC1A2, a glutamate transporter, is recurrently fused to CD44 in gastric
carcinomas. In this context, SLC1A2 is overexpressed and has pro-oncogenic
effects (PMID: 21471434). SLC1A2 fusions have more recently been identified in
colon carcinoma (APIP-SLC1A2) (PMID:23637631). In both contexts, SLC1A2
 




 

breakpoints appear common in the 5' portion of the gene/intron 1, as seen in
this case.

INTERPRETATION:
SOMATIC VARIANTS:

MSH2 c,2131C>T (p.R711*) - MSH2 is a tumor suppressor gene involved in DNA
mismatch repair. Heterozygous loss of function mutations in mismatch repair
genes are associated with a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome. This
variant, MSH2 p.R711*, is a nonsense mutation which leads to protein truncation
and is a known pathogenic variant associated with Lynch syndrome. This assay
does not distinguish between somatic and germline alterations. However in the
context of known MSH2 and MSH6 loss of expression in the tumor cells (see BS14-
35312), this finding is highly suggestive of a germline variant. Correlation
with clinical and family history is recommended.

KRAS c.35G>A (p.G12D) - This variant, KRAS p.G12D, is present at a mutational
hotspot in KRAS. Activating KRAS mutations have been associated with lack of
benefit to anti-EGFR therapy (cetuximab) in the setting of advanced colorectal
cancer (PMID: 18946061, 20619739).

APC c.4660 4661GA>G (p.E1554fs) - *APC nonsense mutations are frequent in
inherited and sporadic colon cancer. Reduced APC activity enhances Wnt
signalling.

MSH2 c.1249 1249G>GT (p.V417fs) - *Variants of MSH2 may be seen as germline
events in which case they may be associated with inherited cancer syndromes ; in
addition, MSH2 variants may be seen as acquired (somatic) events in some tumor
types. Given the allele frequency and tumor percentage, this variant is likely a
somatic variant and may represent a "second hit" leading to total loss of MSH2
expression in the tumor cell population.

This is a highly mutated tumor with a predominance of small insertion-deletion
mutations characteristic of mismatch repair deficiency and Lynch syndrome-
associated colon cancer.

*** These variants may have a role in cancer biology, or may have shown

potential future clinical application in in vitro studies, but as yet no
clinical role for this mutation has been established as standard-of-careA in the

published medical literature.
COPY NUMBER ALTERATIONS (CNA):

No significant alterations are detected by copy number variant analysis.
 




TEST INFORMATION

Background:

Somatic genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes contribute
to the pathogenesis and evolution of human cancers. These alterations can
provide prognostic and predictive information and stratify cancers for targeted
therapeutic information. We classify these alterations into five tiers using the
following guidelines:

Tier 1: The alteration has well-established published evidence confirming
clinical utility in this tumor type, in at least one of the following contexts:
predicting response to treatment with an FDA-approved therapy; assessing
prognosis; establishing a definitive diagnosis; or conferring an inherited
increased risk of cancer to this patient and family.

Tier 2: The alteration may have clinical utility in at least one of the
following contexts: selection. of an investigational therapy in clinical trials
for this cancer type; limited evidence of prognostic association; supportive of
a specific diagnosis; proven association of response to treatment with an FDA-
approved therapy in a different type of cancer; or similar to a different
mutation with a proven association with response to treatment with an FDA-
approved therapy in this type of cancer.

Tier 3: The alteration is of uncertain clinical utility, but may have a role as
suggested by at least one of the following: demonstration of association with
response to treatment in this cancer type in preclinical studies (e.g., in vitro
studies or animal models); alteration in a biochemical pathway that has other
known, therapeutically-targetable alterations; alteration in a highly conserved
region of the protein predicted, in silico, to alter protein function; or
selection of an investigational therapy for a different cancer type.

Tier 4: The alteration is novel or its significance has not been studied in
cancer.

Tier 5: The alteration has been determined to have no clinical utility, either
for selecting therapy, assessing prognosis, establishing a diagnosis, or
determining hereditary disease risk.

Method:

We have developed a cancer genomic assay to detect somatic mutations, copy
number variations and structural variants in tumor DNA extracted from fresh,
frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. The OncoPanel assay surveys
exonic DNA sequences of 447 cancer genes and 191 regions across 60 genes for
rearrangement detection. DNA is isolated from tissue containing at least 20%
tumor nuclei and analyzed by massively parallel sequencing using a solution-
phase Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture kit and an Illumina HiSeq 2500

sequencer.

The 447 genes are: ABCB11, ABL1, ACVR1, AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, ALK, APC, AR, ARAF,
ARHGAP35, ARHGEF12, ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, ASXL1, ATM, ATR, ATRX, AURKA, AURKB,
