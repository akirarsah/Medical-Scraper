Background:

Somatic mutations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes contribute to the
pathogenesis and evolution of human cancers. These alterations can provide prognostic and
predictive information and stratify cancers for targeted therapeutic information.

Method:

We have developed a multiplexed assay to detect somatic mutations in tumor DNA
extracted from fresh, frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. The assay
OncoMap 4 detects mutations in 472 different loci from 41 cancer genes. DNA is isolated
from tissue containing at least 50% tumor nuclei and analyzed by multiplex PCR
amplification of the region containing the nucleotide variant of interest, an optimized
primer extension reaction to generate allele-specific DNA products, and chip-based mass
spectrometry for separation and analysis of the DNA analytes (Sequenom MassARRAY 4). The
41 genes are: ABL1, AKT1, AKT2, APC, BRAF, CDK4, CDKN2A, CSF1R, CTNNB1, EGFR, ERBB2,
FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FLT3, GNA11, GNAQ, GNAS, HRAS, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, JAK3, KIT, KRAS,
MAP2K1,. MET, MLH1, MYC, NPM1, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN, RB1, RET, SRC, STK11,
TP53, VHL. A: full listing of the loci tested can be found at PCMP or by contacting the
