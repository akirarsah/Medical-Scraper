INTERPRETATION:

NRAS Q61K was identified. NRAS mutations predict lack of response to anti-EGFR
therapy in metastatic colorectal carcinoma. These mutations may confer
sensitivity to MEK inhibition in some settings.

Two APC mutations were identified- APC mutations are frequent in inherited and
sporadic colon cancer. Reduced APC activity enhances Wnt signalling.

A stop mutation was identified in CDKN2A. Loss of tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A
(p16, aka INK4a) is a common event in cancer, and leads to cell cycle
dysregulation via disinhibition of CDK4/CDK6. Theoretically, loss of p16
function by some combination of mutation/deletion/epigenetic silencing may
render tumors susceptible to treatment with experimental targeted inhibitors of
CDK4 if RB1 expression is intact.

SMAD4 is a tumor suppressor gene important in regulation of the TGF-beta
signaling pathway. Acquired (somatic) loss of SMAD4 function is an important
step in tumorigenesis in a variety of tumor types including colon cancer (PMID:
23139211 ). Note additional mutations in TS genes TP53 and NF1.

Copy number gains. were mostly arm level changes and include single copy loss of
17p and.18q and gain of 20.

Tumor protein p53 (TP53) gene is a tumor suppressor gene. Somatic TP53 mutations
are frequent in most human cancers, ranging from 5% to 80% depending on the
type, stage and etiology of tumors. Most mutations are missense (75%) and other
include non-sense (7.5%), deletions, insertions or splicing mutations (17.5%).
It appears that there is both mutation and copy loss of TP53 in this sample.
Similarly there is mutation and single copy loss of SMAD4.

No chromosomal rearrangements were identified in this sample.

TEST INFORMATION

Background:

Somatic genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes contribute
to the pathogenesis and evolution of human cancers. These alterations can
provide prognostic and predictive information and stratify cancers for targeted
therapeutic information. We classify these alterations into five tiers using the
following guidelines:

Tier 1: The alteration has well-established published evidence confirming
clinical utility in this tumor type, in at least one of the following contexts:
predicting response to treatment with an FDA-approved therapy; assessing
prognosis; establishing a definitive diagnosis; or conferring an inherited
increased risk of cancer to this patient and family.

Tier 2: The alteration may have clinical utility in at least one of the
following contexts: selection of an investigational therapy in clinical trials
for this cancer type; limited evidence of prognostic association; supportive of
a specific diagnosis; proven association of response to treatment with an FDA-
approved therapy in a different type of cancer; or similar to a different
 Accession: BL-14-E05512

mutation with a proven association with response to treatment with an FDA-
approved therapy in this type of cancer.

Tier 3: The alteration is of uncertain clinical utility, but may have a role as
suggested by at least one of the following: demonstration of association with
response to treatment in this cancer type in preclinical studies (e.g., in vitro
studies or animal models); alteration in a biochemical pathway that has other
known, therapeutically-targetable alterations; alteration in a highly conserved
region of the protein predicted, in silico, to alter protein function; or
selection of an investigational therapy for a different cancer type.

Tier 4: The alteration is novel or its significance has not been studied in
cancer.

Tier 5: The alteration has been determined to have no clinical utility, either
for selecting therapy, assessing prognosis, establishing a diagnosis, or
determining hereditary disease risk.

Method:

We have developed a cancer genomic assay to detect somatic mutations, copy
number variations and structural variants in tumor DNA extracted from fresh,
frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. The OncoPanel assay surveys
exonic DNA sequences of 447 cancer genes and 191 regions across 60 genes for
rearrangement detection. DNA is isolated from tissue containing at least 20%
tumor nuclei and analyzed by massively parallel sequencing using a solution-
phase Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture kit and an Illumina HiSeq 2500
sequencer.
