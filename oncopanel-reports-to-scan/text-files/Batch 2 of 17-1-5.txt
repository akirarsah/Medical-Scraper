Comments: Tumor content was too low for accurate assessment of copy number, particularly
with regard to low level amplifications or single copy losses. Please interpret with
caution.Mutations seen at a frequency of 50% or 100% may be germline sequence alterations
with no specific implications for the prognosis or management of a patient's cancer,
particularly when the percentage of cancer cells within the tumor sample is neither 50%

nor 100%.
 




 

TEST INFORMATION

Background:

Somatic genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes contribute to the
pathogenesis and evolution of human cancers. These alterations can provide prognostic and
predictive information and stratify cancers for targeted therapeutic information. We
classify these alterations into five tiers using the following guidelines:

Tier 1: The. alteration has well-established published evidence confirming clinical
utility in this tumor type, in at least one of the following contexts: predicting
response to treatment with an FDA-approved therapy; assessing;prognosis; establishing a
definitive diagnosis; or conferring an inherited increased risk of cancer to this patient

and family.

Tier 2: The alteration may have clinical utility in at least one of the following
contexts: selection of an investigational therapy in clinical trials for this cancer
type; limited evidence of prognostic association; supportive of a specific diagnosis;
proven association of response to treatment with an FDA-approved therapy in a different
type of cancer; or similar to a different mutation with a proven association with
response to treatment with an FDA-approved therapy in this type of cancer.

Tier 3: The alteration is of uncertain clinical utility, but may have a role as suggested
by at least one of the following: demonstration of association with response to treatment
in this cancer type in preclinical studies (e.g., in vitro studies or animal models);
alteration in a biochemical pathway that has other known, therapeutically-targetable
alterations; alteration in a highly conserved region of the protein predicted, in silico,
to alter protein function; or selection of an investigational therapy for a different

cancer type.
Tier 4: The alteration is novel or its significance has not been studied in cancer.

Tier 5: The alteration has been determined to have no clinical utility, either for
selecting therapy, assessing prognosis, establishing a diagnosis, or determining
hereditary disease risk.

Method:

We have developed a cancer genomic assay to detect somatic mutations, copy number
variations and structural variants in tumor DNA extracted from fresh, frozen or formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded samples. The OncoPanel assay surveys exonic DNA sequences of 447
cancer genes and 191 regions across 60 genes for rearrangement detection. DNA is isolated
from tissue containing at least 20% tumor nuclei and analyzed by massively parallel
sequencing using a solution-phase Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture kit and an Illumina
HiSeq 2500 sequencer.

The 447 genes are: ABCB11, ABL1, ACVR1, AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, ALK, APC, AR, ARAF, ARHGAP35,
ARHGEF12, ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, ASXL1, ATM, ATR, ATRX, AURKA, AURKB, AXIN2, AXL, B2M,
BABAM1, BAP1, BARD1, BCL11B, BCL2, BCL2L1, BCL2L12, BCL6, BCOR, BCORL1, BLM, BMPR1A,
