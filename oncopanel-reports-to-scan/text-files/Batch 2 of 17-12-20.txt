CHROMOSOMAL REARRANGEMENT :

No structural variants were detected in any of the genes tested. Note that many
structural rearrangements are associated with DNA changes in introns, and the
ability of this test to detect these rearrangements is limited to selected
portions of selected introns of only 30 genes (see list below). Therefore, the
absence of a rearrangement by this method is not a definitive result, and
requires confirmation by an alternative method (e.g., FISH or karyotype) in the

appro

INTERPRETATION:
 Accession: BL-14-A34982

 

 Patient Name: MELVIN, KYLE


SOMATIC VARIANTS:
ETV6 c.1228G>T (p.E410*) - **ETV6 is a transcriptional repressor. frameshift

mutation of ETV6 is likely to reduce the function and up-regulate the expression
of its target genes.

TP53 c.404G>T (p.C1i35F) - **Tumor protein p53 (TP53) gene is a tumour
suppressor gene. Somatic TP53 mutations occur in ~50% of colorectal
adenocarcinomas. Most mutations are missense (75%) and others include nonsense
(7.5%), deletions, insertions or splicing mutations (17.5%). TP53 gene mutation
may be associated with poorer prognosis in colorectal tumors.

*** These variants may have a role in cancer biology, or may have shown
potential future clinical application in in vitro studies, but as yet no
clinical role for this mutation has been established as standard-of-careA in the
published medical literature.

COPY NUMBER ALTERATIONS (CNA):

CNA analysis shows frequent segmental and whole chromosomal copy changes that
are characteristic of colon adenocarcinoma.

Single copy deletion of MAP3K1 at 5q11.2: Deletions involving MAP3Kihave been
reported in over 20% of colon cancers. MAP3K1 regulates the activity of ERK,
JUN and p38 pathways with implications for cell proliferation. Cell culture
studies of other cancers suggest that the loss of MAP3K1 expression may confer
increased responsiveness to paclitaxel.

Single copy deletion of GATA4 at 8p23.1: Loss of the distal portion of 8p
including the GATA4 gene at 8p23.1 is a frequent event across multiple tumor
types suggesting this region contains tumor suppressor gene(s).

Single copy deletion of CDKN2A at 9p21.3: CDKN2A is a known tumor suppressor.
Deletion of CDKN2A is common in tumors and sometimes associated with poor
prognosis.

Single copy deletion of PTEN at 10q23.31: PTEN is a negative regulator of the
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Biallelic inactivation may predict sensitivity to
PI3K pathway inhibitors

Low copy number gain of RB1 at 13q14.2: Gains of large genomic regions on 13q
have been previously described in colon cancer (PMID: 23594372).

Single copy deletion of TP53 at 17p13.1: Deletions on chromosome 17p have been
reported to be associated with the pathopysiology of colon cancer (PMID:
14580770)

High copy number gain of ERBB2 at 17q12: ERBB2 amplification is seen in ~6% of
colon cancers and correlates with rectal location. ERBB2 amplification predicts
response to targeted inhibitors in other tumor types; the predictive
significance of this alteration in colorectal carcinomas is unknown.
 
,




 

Single copy deletion of STK11 at 19p13.3: STK11/LKB1 is a critical regulator of
mTOR pathway signaling. STK11 inactivation is mediated by loss of function
mutations and/or copy number loss in a variety of tumor types and may predict
response to mTOR inhibitors.

Single copy deletion of SMARCA4 at 19p13.2: Alterations in components of the
SWI/SNF complex have been reported in various tumor types and may occur as part
of certain syndromes (PMID: 23355908, 23929686).

TEST INFORMATION

Background:

Somatic .genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes contribute
to the pathogenesis and evolution of human cancers. These alterations can
provide prognostic and predictive information and stratify cancers for targeted
therapeutic information. We classify these alterations into five tiers using the
following guidelines:

Tier 1: The alteration has well-established published evidence confirming
clinical utility in this tumor type, in at least one of the following contexts:
predicting response to treatment with an FDA-approved therapy; assessing
prognosis; establishing a definitive diagnosis; or conferring an inherited
increased. risk of cancer to this patient and family.

Tier 2: The alteration may have clinical utility in at least one of the
following contexts: selection of an investigational therapy in clinical trials
for this cancer type; limited evidence of prognostic association;,. supportive of
a specific diagnosis; proven association of response to treatment with an FDA-
approved therapy in a.different type of cancer} or similar to a different
mutation with a proven association with response to treatment with an FDA-
approved therapy in this type of cancer.

Tier 3: The alteration is of uncertain clinical utility, but may have a role as
suggested by at least one of the following: demonstration of association with
response to treatment in this cancer type in preclinical studies (e.g., in vitro
studies or animal models); alteration in a biochemical pathway that has other
known, therapeutically-targetable alterations; alteration in a highly conserved
region of the protein predicted, in silico, to alter protein function; or
selection of an investigational therapy for a different cancer type.

Tier 4: The alteration is novel or its significance has not been studied in
cancer.

Tier 5: The alteration has been determined to have no clinical utility, either
for selecting therapy, assessing prognosis, establishing a diagnosis, or
determining hereditary disease risk.
 




 

Method:

We have developed a cancer genomic assay to detect somatic mutations, copy
number variations and structural variants in tumor DNA extracted from fresh,
frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. The OncoPanel assay surveys
exonic DNA sequences of 447 cancer genes and 191 regions across 60 genes for
rearrangement detection. DNA is isolated from tissue containing at least 20%
tumor nuclei and analyzed by massively parallel sequencing using a solution-
phase Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture kit and an Illumina HiSeq 2500
sequencer.

The 447 genes are: ABCB11, ABL1, ACVR1, AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, ALK, APC, AR, ARAF,
