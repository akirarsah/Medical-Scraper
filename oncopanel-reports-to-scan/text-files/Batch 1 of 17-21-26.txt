Comments: SOMATIC VARIANTS:MLH1 c.826A>G (p.I276V) - *Variants of MLH1 may be seen as

germline events in which case they may be associated with inherited cancer syndromes ; in
 




 

addition, MLH1 variants may be seen as acquired (somatic) events in some tumor types.
This particular variant has not been reported in cancer, to my knowledge. Recommend
correlation with clinical history and other lab findings to assess for DNA mismatch
repair defects. Depending on clinical findings and family history, genetic counseling may
be helpful, if clinically indicated.APC c.1411G>T (p.G471*) - *Mutations of APC may be
associated with a hereditary cancer syndrome when they affect the germline; however, APC
mutations are common in both hereditary and sporadic cancers. Genetic counseling may be
warranted if family history or other clinical information suggests an increased cancer
risk. This is a termination variant that will likely cause inactivation of the
protein.TP53 c.390_427CAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTG>G (p.L130fs) - *The TP53
R248Q variant is common in colon adenocarcinoma. Tumor protein p53. (TP53) gene is a
tumour suppressor gene. Somatic TP53 mutations occur in ~50% of colorectal
adenocarcinomas. Most mutations are missense (75%) and others include nonsense (7.5%),
deletions, insertions or splicing mutations (17.5%). TP53 gene mutation may be associated
with poorer prognosis in colorectal tumors. This particular nonsense frameshift mutation
has not been previously reported. The allele frequency is a bit low, which might suggest
a subclone, especially in combination with the copy number analysis showing loss at 17p;
however, deletions of this size frequently do not map properly to the reference genome
and, therefore, their true frequency can be underestimated by next generation sequencing.
*** These variants may have a role in cancer biology, or may have shown potential future
clinical application in in vitro studies, but as yet no clinical role for this mutation
has been established as standard-of-careA in the published medical literature.COPY NUMBER
ALTERATIONS (CNA):CNA analysis shows several large abnormalities, including gains at 7p,
13, and 20, and loss at 14q and 17p

TEST INFORMATION

Background:

Somatic genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes contribute to the
pathogenesis and evolution of human cancers. These alterations can provide. prognostic and
predictive information and stratify cancers for targeted therapeutic information. We
classify these alterations into five tiers using the following guidelines: ©

Tier 1: The alteration has well-established published evidence confirming clinical
utility in this tumor type, in at least one of the following contexts: predicting
response to treatment with an FDA-approved therapy; assessing prognosis; establishing a
definitive diagnosis; or conferring an inherited increased risk of cancer to this patient

and family.

Tier 2: The alteration may have clinical utility in at least one of the following
contexts: selection of an investigational therapy in clinical trials for this cancer
type; limited evidence of prognostic association; supportive of a specific diagnosis;
proven association of response to treatment with an FDA-approved therapy in a different
type of cancer; or similar to a different mutation with a proven association with
response to treatment with an FDA-approved therapy in this type of cancer.

Tier 3: The alteration is of uncertain clinical utility, but may have a role as suggested
by at least one of the following: demonstration of association with response to treatment
in this cancer type in preclinical studies (e.g., in vitro studies or animal models) ;
 




 

alteration in a biochemical pathway that has other known, therapeutically-targetable
alterations; alteration in a highly conserved region of the protein predicted, in silico,
to alter protein function; or selection of an investigational therapy for a different

cancer type.

Tier 4: The alteration is novel or its significance has not been studied in cancer.

Tier 5: The alteration has been determined to have no clinical utility, either for
selecting therapy, assessing prognosis, establishing a diagnosis, or determining
hereditary disease risk.

Method:

We have developed a cancer genomic assay to detect somatic mutations, copy number
variations and structural variants in tumor DNA extracted from fresh, frozen or formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded samples. The OncoPanel assay surveys exonic DNA sequences of 447
cancer genes and 191 regions across 60 genes’ for rearrangement detection. DNA is isolated
from tissue containing at least 20% tumor nuclei and analyzed by massively parallel
sequencing using a solution-phase Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture kit and an Illumina
HiSeq 2500 sequencer.
