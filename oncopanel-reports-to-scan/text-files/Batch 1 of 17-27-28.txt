INTERPRETATION:

**To date, there is little published evidence relating these genetic changes to cancer
biology or treatment response precluding the use of this information for decisions
regarding patient management outside the context of clinical research.

TEST INFORMATION

Background:

Somatic mutations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes contribute to the
pathogenesis and evolution of human cancers. These alterations can provide prognostic and
predictive information and stratify cancers for targeted therapeutic information.

Method:

We have developed a multiplexed assay to detect somatic mutations in tumor DNA
extracted from fresh, frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. The assay
OncoMap 4 detects mutations in 472 different loci from 41 cancer genes. DNA is isolated
from tissue containing at least 50% tumor nuclei and analyzed by multiplex PCR
amplification of the region containing the nucleotide variant of interest, an optimized
primer extension reaction to generate allele-specific DNA products, and chip-based mass
spectrometry for separation and analysis of the DNA analytes (Sequenom MassARRAY 4). The
41 genes are: ABL1, AKT1, AKT2, APC, BRAF, CDK4, CDKN2A, CSF1R, CTNNB1, EGFR, ERBB2,
FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FLT3, GNA11, GNAQ, GNAS, HRAS, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, JAK3, KIT, KRAS,
MAP2K1, MET, MLH1, MYC, NPM1, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN, RB1, RET, SRC, STK11,
TP53, VHL: A full listing of the loci tested can be found at PCMP or by contacting the
Center for Advanced Molecular Diagnostics (857-307-1500).

These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the
, Brigham and Womendé€™s Hospital. They have not been
cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that
such clearance or approval is not necessary.
