INTERPRETATION:

APC c.4308delT (p.S1436fs*37) - Germline mutations of APC are indicative of a hereditary

cancer syndrome, although APC mutations are very common in both hereditary and sporadic
colorectal cancer. Genetic counseling may be warranted if family history or other

clinical information suggests an increased cancer risk.
TP53 c.630_630C>AC (p.N210fs) - *frameshift mutation of TP53 is likely to be loss of

function mutation.
 




 

TP53 c.630_630C>AC (p.N210fs) - # Although limited information is known for this
alteration in this tumor type, there is CLINICAL EVIDENCE for an association between this
alteration IN ANOTHER TUMOR TYPE.

*** These variants may have a role in cancer biology, or may have shown potential future
clinical application in in vitro studies, but as yet no clinical role for this mutation
has been established as standard-of-careA in the published medical literature.

Comments: Copy number variation (CNV) analysis shows a complex karyotype with several
whole-chromosome and whole-level gains and losses including -1, +2, +3p, -4q, +5q, +6, -
10q, +12q, +13q, i(17q), -18q, -20q, -21q and -22q.There is one copy loss of APC and TP53
and the remaining copy has loss-of-function frameshift mutation, rendering functional
homozygous loss of function for both genes.

TEST INFORMATION

Background:

Somatic genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes contribute to the
pathogenesis and evolution of human cancers. These alterations can provide prognostic and
predictive information and stratify cancers for targeted therapeutic information. We
classify these alterations into five tiers using the following guidelines:

Tier 1: The alteration has well-established published evidence confirming clinical
utility in this tumor type, in at least one of the following contexts: predicting
response to treatment with an FDA-approved therapy; assessing prognosis; establishing a
definitive diagnosis; or conferring an inherited increased risk of cancer to this patient
and family.

Tier 2: The alteration may have clinical utility in at least one of the following
contexts: selection of an investigational therapy in;clinical trials for this cancer
type; limited evidence of prognostic association; supportive of a specific diagnosis;
proven association,of.response to treatment with an FDA-approved therapy in a different
type of cancer; or similar to a different mutation with a proven association with
response to treatment with an FDA-approved therapy in this type of cancer.

Tier 3: The alteration is of uncertain clinical utility, but may have a role as suggested
by at least one of the following: demonstration of association with response to treatment
in this cancer type in preclinical studies (e.g., in vitro studies or animal models) ;
alteration in a biochemical pathway that has other known, therapeutically-targetable
alterations; alteration in a highly conserved region of the protein predicted, in silico,
to alter protein function; or selection of an investigational therapy for a different

cancer type.

Tier 4: The alteration is novel or its significance has not been studied in cancer.

Tier 5: The alteration has been determined to have no clinical utility, either for
selecting therapy, assessing prognosis, establishing a diagnosis, or determining
hereditary disease risk.
 




 

Method:

We have developed a cancer genomic assay to detect somatic mutations, copy number
variations and structural variants in tumor DNA extracted from fresh, frozen or formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded samples. The OncoPanel assay surveys exonic DNA sequences of 447
cancer genes and 191 regions across 60 genes for rearrangement detection. DNA is isolated
from tissue containing at least 20% tumor nuclei and analyzed by massively parallel
sequencing using a solution-phase Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture kit and an Illumina

HiSeq 2500 sequencer.
