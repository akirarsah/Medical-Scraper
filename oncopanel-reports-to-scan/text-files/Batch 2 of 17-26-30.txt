INTERPRETATION:

SOMATIC VARIANTS:

KRAS c.35G>A (p.G12D) -)| This variant, KRAS p.G12D, is present at a mutational

hotspot in KRAS. Activating KRAS mutations have been associated with lack of
benefit to anti-EGFR therapy (cetuximab) in the setting of advanced colorectal
cancer (PMID: 18946061, 20619739).

PIK3CA c.1633G>A (p.E545K) —- *This variant, PIK3CA p.E545K, occurs at a
mutational hotspot and has been demonstrated to be oncogenic (PMID: 15647370).
PIK3CA mutations have. been associated with sensitivity to PI3K pathway
inhibition in preclinical models of colorectal cancer (PMID: 23475782) and in
early clinical trials of other tumor types (PMID: 22271473). In addition,
aspirin use has been associated with improved outcome in PIK3CA-mutant
colorectal cancer in a large retrospective study (PMID: 23094721).

FBXW7 c.275C>G (p.S92*) - **FBXW7 is a tumor suppressor gene that downregulates
the prosurvival protein MCL1. Some studies suggest that loss of FBXW7 may confer
resistance to antitubulin chemotherapeutics such as Taxol and vincristine.

*** These variants may have a role in cancer biology, or may have shown
potential future clinical application in in vitro studies, but as yet no
clinical role for this mutation has been established as standard-of-careA in the
published medical literature.

TEST INFORMATION

Background:

Somatic genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes contribute
to the pathogenesis and evolution of human cancers. These alterations can
provide prognostic and predictive information and stratify cancers. for targeted
therapeutic information. We classify these alterations into five tiers using the
following guidelines:

Tier 1: The alteration has well-established published evidence confirming
clinical utility in this tumor type, in at least one of the following contexts:
predicting response to treatment. with an FDA-approved therapy; assessing
prognosis; establishing a definitive diagnosis; or conferring an inherited
increased risk of cancer to this patient and family.

Tier 2: The alteration may have clinical utility in at least one of the
following contexts: selection of an investigational therapy in clinical trials
for this cancer type; limited evidence of prognostic association; supportive of
a specific diagnosis; proven association of response to treatment with an FDA-
approved therapy in a different type of cancer; or similar to a different
mutation with a proven association with response to treatment with an FDA-
approved therapy in this type of cancer.

Tier 3: The alteration is of uncertain clinical utility, but may have a role as
suggested by at least one of the following: demonstration of association with
response to treatment in this cancer type in preclinical studies (e.g., in vitro
studies or animal models); alteration in a biochemical pathway that has other
known, therapeutically-targetable alterations; alteration inja highly conserved
region of the protein predicted, in silico, to alter protein function; or
selection of an investigational therapy for a, different cancer type.

Tier 4: The alteration is novel or its significance has not been studied in
cancer.

Tier 5: The alteration has been determined to have no clinical utility, either
for selecting therapy, assessing prognosis, establishing a diagnosis, or
determining hereditary disease risk.

Method:

We have developed a cancer genomic assay to detect somatic mutations, copy
number variations and structural variants in tumor DNA extracted from fresh,
frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. The OncoPanel assay surveys
exonic DNA sequences of 447 cancer genes and 191 regions across 60 genes for
rearrangement detection. DNA is isolated from tissue containing at least 20%
tumor nuclei and analyzed by massively parallel sequencing using a solution-
