Chromosomal Rearrangement:

A translocation involving APC (5q22, exon 16) and the TTC28 gene (22q12, intron
2) was detected.This rearrangement, to my knowledge, has not been reported
previously, although a recent TCGA study found 21 cases of colon cancers with
gene fusions involving the TTC28 gene, each of which was believed to inactivate
this gene, which is involved in TP53 regulation. In this case, the fusion with
APC is particularly curious, as APC is a well known tumor suppressor gene lost
in colon cancer and, in this case, a mutation in APC is also
identified.Importantly, this technology is experimental for translocation .
detection, and i recommend confirmation of this finding with an alternative
technique.

INTERPRETATION:

SOMATIC VARIANTS:
 




 

KRAS c.38G>A (p.G13D) - Mutations in KRAS codons 12 and 13 predict lack of
response to therapy with antibodies targeted to the epidermal grown factor
receptor (e.g.cetuximab, panitumumab) .

APC c.2805C>A (p.¥935*) - *Germline mutations of APC are indicative of a
hereditary cancer syndrome, although APC mutations are very common in both
hereditary and sporadic colorectal cancer. Genetic counseling may be warranted
if family history or other clinical information suggests an increased cancer
risk.

FBXW7 c.1393C>T (p.R465C) - **FBXW7 R465 is a hotspot for somatic mutation in
cancers and is likely to be partial loss-of-function mutation.

*** These variants may have a role in cancer biology, or may have shown
potential future clinical application in in vitro studies, but as yet no
clinical role for this mutation has been established as standard-of-careA in the
published medical literature.

COPY NUMBER ALTERATIONS (CNA):

CNA analysis shows Single copy deletion of GATA4 at 8p23.1: Loss of the distal
portion of 8p including the GATA4 gene at 8p23.1 is a frequent event across
multiple tumor types suggesting this region contains tumor suppressor gene(s).

Low copy number gain of MYC at 8q24.21: MYC transcriptional targets appear to be
affected in most colon carcinomas, suggesting this pathway is critical to colon
carcinogenesis.

Single copy deletion of TP53 at 17p13.1: Deletions on chromosome 17p have been
reported to be associated with the pathopysiology of colon cancer (PMID:
14580770)

TEST INFORMATION

Background:

Somatic genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes contribute
to the pathogenesis and evolution of human cancers. These alterations can
provide prognostic and predictive information and stratify cancers for targeted
therapeutic information. We classify these alterations into five tiers using the
following guidelines:

Tier 1: The alteration has well-established published evidence confirming
clinical utility in this tumor type, in at least one of the following contexts:
predicting response to treatment with an FDA-approved therapy; assessing
 




 

prognosis; establishing a definitive diagnosis; or conferring an inherited
increased risk of cancer to this patient and family.

Tier 2: The alteration may have clinical utility in at least one of the
following contexts: selection of an investigational therapy in clinical trials
for this cancer type; limited evidence of prognostic association; supportive of
a specific diagnosis; proven association of response to treatment with an FDA-
approved therapy in a different type of cancer; or similar to a different
mutation with a proven association with response to treatment with an FDA-
approved therapy in this type of cancer.

Tier 3: The alteration is of uncertain clinical utility, but may have a role as
suggested by at least one of the following: demonstration of association with
response to treatment in this cancer type in preclinical studies (e.g., in vitro
studies or animal models); alteration in a biochemical pathway that has other
known, therapeutically-targetable alterations; alteration in a highly conserved
region of the protein predicted,.in silico, to alter protein function; or
selection of an investigational therapy for a different cancer type.

Tier 4: The alteration is novel or its significance has not been studied in
cancer.

Tier 5: The alteration has been determined to have no clinical utility, either
for selecting therapy, assessing prognosis, establishing a diagnosis, or
determining hereditary disease risk.

Method:

We have developed a cancer genomic assay to detect somatic mutations, copy |
number variations and structural variants in tumor DNA extracted from fresh,

frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. The OncoPanel assay surveys

exonic DNA sequences of 447 cancer genes and 191 regions across 60 genes for

rearrangement detection. DNA is isolated from tissue containing at least 20%

tumor nuclei and analyzed by massively parallel sequencing using a solution-

phase Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture kit and an Illumina HiSeq 2500

sequencer.
